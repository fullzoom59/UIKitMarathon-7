# New Stretch Picture assignment. Due by July 21 21:00

At the top of the screen is a picture, under the picture is a scrolling area. The height of the picture is 270pt

* If you scroll down, the picture is stretched. The top edge is attached to the top of the screen
* If you scroll up, the picture goes to the top along with the scroll
* The scroll indicator (the bar on the right) is always below the picture and should not get on top of it
